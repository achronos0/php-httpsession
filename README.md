# useful
Useful is a PHP non-framework. Take the classes you want, leave the rest.

Goals:
* Utility
  Useful provides convenience that is not easily found anywhere else.
  It solves common challenges that are not well addressed by the PHP language,
  common frameworks or popular libraries.
* Simplicity
  Useful can be used quickly without lots of reading and training.
  Class hierarchy is flat.
  Each class does one thing.
  All classes are intended to be directly used by application developers.
* Easy integration
  Useful does not require you to do anything.
  It has no internal dependencies and few external dependencies.
  Every class stands on its own and can be used on its own.

## Notes
At the moment (2016-06) Useful is very young. It only has one class.

I have access to a suite of classes that were originally private but which
I now have license to update and release open-source.

As I can, I will polish individual pieces and add them in.
